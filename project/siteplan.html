    <main>
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <h2>"WithYou"</h2>
        <p>I chose the name "WithYou" because it captures the essence of my project's primary goal, which is to offer
            companionship and support to people battling mental illnesses. It spreads the idea that nobody has to
            confront their difficulties alone.</p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>"WithYou" aims to provide a supportive online platform where individuals dealing with mental disorders can
            find
            community, resources, and information to feel less isolated and more empowered in their journey towards
            mental well-being. Through articles, forums, and other tools, the site offers practical guidance, peer
            support, and educational content to help users navigate their mental health challenges with confidence and
            resilience.</p>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>How do I know if I might be suffering from a mental disorder?</p>
        <p>Are there other people like me who are experiencing similar challenges with my mental disorder?</p>
        <p>How can I connect with others who understand what I'm going through with my mental disorder?</p>
